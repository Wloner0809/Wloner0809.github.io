Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I am a senior undergraduate student from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and currently work as a research intern at [MSR Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia-zh-cn/), under the supervision of [Furu Wei](https://thegenerality.com/) and the mentorship of [Nan Yang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nanya/), [Liang Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wangliang/). My research interest mainly lies in:
- **LLM Reasoning:** Train reasoning models with long-thinking capabilities, similar to OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, or enhance model reasoning abilities through alternative methods such as hidden CoT. Meanwhile, investigate the inference scaling laws of reasoning.
- **AI Alignment:** Explore the application of different *RLHF* and *RL* algorithms across various scenarios.
- **Agent:** Build search agents (DeepResearch).

I am always eager for discussions and collaborations! Feel free to email me!




## Education
- **B.E in Computer Science**, 2021 - 2025(expected), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), Hefei, Anhui, China
